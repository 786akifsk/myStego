Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography
Introduction
This project implements steganography to securely hide data inside an image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. It ensures confidential communication without raising suspicion, making it useful for secure messaging and privacy protection.

Features
✅ Secure Data Hiding: Uses LSB technique to embed text inside an image.
✅ Data Extraction: Ability to extract hidden data from the stego image.
✅ Encryption: Can encrypt the message before embedding for extra security.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
OpenCV – For image processing
Platform: Windows/Linux
Algorithm Used: LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography
