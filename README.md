# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

## Introduction
This project implements steganography to securely hide data inside an image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. It ensures confidential communication without raising suspicion.
## Features
- ✅ **Secure Data Hiding**: Uses LSB technique to embed text inside an image.
- ✅ **Data Extraction**: Ability to extract hidden data from the stego image.
- ✅ **Encryption**: Can encrypt the message before embedding for extra security.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Library Used**:
  - OpenCV – For image processing
- **Platform**: Windows/Linux
- **Algorithm Used**: LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography

## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the OpenCV library using this command
```bash
bash pip install opencv-python
